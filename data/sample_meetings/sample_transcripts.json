      "transcript": "We discussed the user authentication flow. When a user logs in, the system first validates their credentials, then checks their permissions, and finally grants access to the appropriate modules. The sequence involves multiple interactions between the frontend, backend, and database. We need to handle different user roles and their specific access rights.",

      "transcript": "We need to design the User class with attributes like username, email, and password. The User class should inherit from BaseEntity and have relationships with Role and Permission classes. Each User can have multiple Roles, and each Role can have multiple Permissions. We also discussed the Product class and Order class relationships.",

      "transcript": "The business process starts when a customer submits an order. If the item is in stock, we process it immediately. If not, we check with suppliers. Based on the supplier response, we either fulfill the order or notify the customer of delays. This involves multiple decision points and parallel processes.",

The system needs to handle user authentication, order processing, and reporting. We need to design classes for User, Order, Product, and Payment. The system architecture includes multiple components: frontend, backend, database, and external APIs. Users will interact with the system through various use cases including registration, ordering, and account management.",
