text = "So, for the new user management module, I think we should begin by designing the core entities We’ll need a User entity with fields like id, username, email, and password, and each user can be assigned one or more roles That means we also need a Role entity, and since roles can have multiple permissions, we’ll probably want a separate Permission table or class Relationships are many-to-many in both cases From a class perspective, the User class should extend a BaseEntity that holds shared fields like id and createdAt We should also define methods like getRoles() and addRole() in the User class I also suggest we create an interface UserService with a concrete implementation UserServiceImpl This service layer will be used by the controller in the web layer In terms of interactions, when a user logs in, the frontend should send a login request to the backend, which should validate the credentials, fetch the roles, and return a token So we can represent that in a sequence diagram. The database will be used to persist users and roles Also, we need to ensure the relationships are clear in the ERD so the database schema is generated properly."
