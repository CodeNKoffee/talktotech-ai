## AI & Automation Unpacked Hackathon Submission

This repository showcases AI-powered automation solutions developed during the **IBM AI & Automation Unpacked Hackathon**. Our project focuses on leveraging **IBM Granite models**, accessible via open-source platforms or **IBM watsonx.ai**, to create innovative tools that enhance efficiency and transform business processes.

---

## üöÄ The Challenge

The hackathon's core objective was to design and build proof-of-concept AI solutions using IBM Granite models (including Granite 3.3 for reasoning and speech, and Granite 4.0 Tiny for long-context tasks). These models are designed for enterprise applications, enabling automation, enhanced decision-making, and innovation across various domains.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

*(This section will be detailed by your team, outlining your specific project idea, its features, and how it utilizes IBM Granite models to solve a particular problem, e.g., a smart meeting summarizer or a diagram generator.)*

### Team Members

* **Ahmed Dabour**
* **Hatem Soliman**
* **Layla Khaled**
* **Salma Tarek Soliman**
* **Yasmeen Tarek**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **IBM Granite Models:** Leveraging their capabilities for text generation, reasoning, summarization, and potentially speech-to-text.
* **IBM watsonx.ai:** The cloud-based platform for accessing and experimenting with Granite models via Prompt Lab, API, and SDK.
* **[Potentially] Open-source platforms:** Such as Hugging Face for model access, Ollama for local inference, or the BeeAI Agentic Framework for building intelligent agents.
* *(Add any other specific tools, frameworks, or programming languages relevant to your project, e.g., Python, LangChain, etc.)*

---

## üìù Getting Started

To explore or run components of this project:

### Prerequisites

* Familiarity with **IBM Granite models** and their applications.
* Understanding of **IBM watsonx.ai** for cloud-based model interaction.
* Basic concepts of **AI automation** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
* *(Specify any required programming languages or development environments.)*

### Installation & Setup

*(Provide clear instructions on how to set up and run your specific solution. This might include API key configuration, environment variables, and dependency installation.)*

For general hackathon guidelines on using IBM Granite, please refer to the **AI & Automation Unpacked Hackathon Guide PDF**. This guide covers:

* Accessing Granite models on Hugging Face or via Ollama for local execution.
* Using IBM watsonx.ai's Prompt Lab and programmatic access (API/SDK).
* System requirements for local model inference (e.g., 32 GB RAM, GPU).

## üí° Use Cases Addressed

*(Based on your team's project, briefly describe the specific business process or industry challenge your solution aims to automate or improve. Referencing the example use cases from the hackathon guide, such as "Smart Meeting Summarizer" or "AI Workflow Orchestrator," can be helpful.)*
