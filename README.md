This repository showcases AI-powered automation solutions developed during the **IBM AI & Automation Unpacked Hackathon** at **IBM TechXchange 2025** (June 26-29, 2025). Our project focuses on leveraging **IBM Granite models** to create innovative tools that transform spoken technical conversations into structured, production-ready system diagrams.

## üöÄ The Challenge

The hackathon's core objective was to design and build proof-of-concept AI solutions using IBM Granite models (including Granite 3.3 for reasoning and speech, and Granite 4.0 Tiny for long-context tasks). These models are designed for enterprise applications, enabling automation, enhanced decision-making, and innovation across various domains.

## üéØ The Problem We Solve

**Most technical meetings are goldmines of ideas. But here's the problem ‚Äî most of that gold never leaves the room.**

Developers talk. Architects plan. PMs listen. But when it comes time to capture it all? You get scattered notes, outdated diagrams, and wasted potential.

That's the bottleneck we're breaking.

## ‚ú® Our Solution: TalkToTech

**An AI-powered system that turns spoken technical conversations into structured, production-ready system diagrams ‚Äî all in one flow.**

### How It Works

1. **Drop your audio file** - Simple upload interface
2. **AI transcription** - Surgical precision speech-to-text conversion
3. **Intelligent analysis** - IBM Granite Instruct reads between the lines, analyzes context, extracts keywords, chooses the right diagram type (sequence, class, architecture), and summarizes it all
4. **Code generation** - IBM Granite Code transforms insights into raw PlantUML and renders clear, professional diagrams with corresponding code in the most applicable programming language (Java, Python, SQL, etc.)

### What Makes Us Different

**It's not just AI ‚Äî it's cognitive architecture.**

Our system thinks like a senior engineer. It doesn't keyword-match. It understands how systems behave, how components interact, and what diagram best captures the logic.

**We're not speeding up a broken process. We're replacing it.**

TalkToTech doesn't just save time ‚Äî it preserves the brilliance that happens in the room.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend (Python + Flask)

Our modular AI pipeline reflects the technical workflow:

- **`meeting_processor`** - Handles audio transcription and transcript summarization using AI models
- **`diagram_selector`** - Takes raw transcript and uses Granite Instruct to output JSON with chosen diagram type and summary
- **`diagram_to_code`** - Uses Granite Code to generate PlantUML syntax from the JSON
- **`meeting_to_diagram`** - Renders PlantUML into SVG images
- **Decoupled architecture** - Connects specialized Granite models in a seamless workflow

### Frontend (React + Vite)

Single-page application providing a clean UI for the powerful backend:

- Audio file upload interface
- Real-time display of AI-generated summaries
- Dynamic SVG diagram rendering
- Intuitive, responsive user experience

### IBM Granite Integration

TalkToTech uses a streamlined pipeline powered entirely by IBM's **granite-3.3-8b-instruct** model:

1. **Transcription**: Uses `incredibly-fast-whisper` model (due to IBM Granite Speech's absence on Replicate) to convert spoken audio into text
2. **Understanding & Summarization**: Granite summarizes the transcript, extracts keywords, and assigns a fitting title
3. **Diagram Selection**: Based on relational/process cues, Granite identifies the best diagram type (e.g., sequence, class, architecture)
4. **UML and Code Generation**: Granite Code generates the chosen UML diagram(s) and their corresponding code in the best applicable programming language
